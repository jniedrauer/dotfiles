My dotfiles repository
======================

Use
---
Clone the dotfiles to your home directory

`git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME clone git@github.com:jniedrauer/dotfiles.git`

Once you have the files in place, start a new shell. You will now have an alias `cfg` for adding and storing dotfiles which points at the bare repo in ~/.dotfiles.
